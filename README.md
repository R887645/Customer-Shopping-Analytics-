# Customer-Shopping-Analytics-
The goal of this project is to analyze retail shopping behavior across 10 Istanbul malls (2021–2023) using Power BI. It transforms raw transaction data into insights on customer demographics, payment preferences, mall performance, and category trends, enabling data‑driven strategies to boost revenue and loyalty.
